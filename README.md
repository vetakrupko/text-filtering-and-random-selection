## JSON Text Filtering and Random Selection
This repository contains R scripts developed as part of a student assistant task. The scripts are designed to filter and extract specific text entries from JSON files, and then randomly select a subset of the filtered data.

### Requirements
- R
- Libraries: jsonlite
Install the required library with:
```r
install.packages("jsonlite")
```

### Usage
Place your JSON files in the /sanctions/ directory.
Run the first script to filter the data.
Use the second script to randomly select and save 100 entries.
